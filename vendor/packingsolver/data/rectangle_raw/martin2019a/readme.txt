"A bottom-up packing approach for modeling the constrained two-dimensional guillotine placement problem"
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

These 300 problem instances were generated with the 2DCPACKGEN of Silva et al. (2014) for the "Two-dimensional Single Large Placement Problem".

The name convention is <os#1_is#2_m#3_#4>, where 
#1 is the id shape of the large object in 2DCPACKGEN, 
#2 id the id shape of the small items in 2DCPACKGEN,
#3 is the number of item types, and
#4 is the number of the instance

Each instances consists of:

Object's length Object's width 
number_of_item_types (m)
length_k width_k copies_k for k = 1...m

For example, instance "os02_is01_m10_01" contains:
